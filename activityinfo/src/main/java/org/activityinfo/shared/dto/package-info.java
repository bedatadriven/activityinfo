 * Data Transfer Objects (DTO) for the {@link org.activityinfo.server.domain domain} classes.
 *
 * Each DTO explicitly defines a subset of the domain object graph to transfer to the client.
 * Although tools exist to enable the sharing of domain objects between server and client code,
 * the way we use DTOs here offer several advantages over the gilead approach. (TO WRITE)
